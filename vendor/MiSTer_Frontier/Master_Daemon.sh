#
# MiSTer Frontier — Master Daemon
#
# Watches /tmp/CORENAME and dispatches to per-core _handler.sh scripts
# whenever the user loads a MiSTer Frontier hybrid core.
#
# A hybrid core is identified by the presence of an executable
# /media/fat/games/{CoreName}/_handler.sh. Drop a handler in any game
# folder and this daemon picks it up automatically — no edits needed
# here when adding a new core.
#
# Runs continuously in the background, started at every boot via
# /media/fat/linux/user-startup.sh. Self-installs into user-startup.sh
# on first run if it isn't there already (so it survives even if the
# install script wasn't executed).
#
# Universal hybrid-core daemon pattern (applied here once for every
# core, instead of duplicated across per-core daemons):
#   - chmod +x on every hybrid binary + handler at startup, since
#     update_all does not preserve the executable bit
#   - SIGTERM -> sleep 1 -> SIGKILL on core switch (engines like
#     OpenBOR's borExit() can hang under SDL2 dummy + keepalive)
#   - Startup zombie sweep filtered by /proc/$pid/cwd, so we only
#     kill OUR processes — never an unrelated binary that happens to
#     share a name
#   - Per-core .s0 cleanup on core switch (re-entry goes through OSD
#     picker, doesn't auto-mount previous PAK/cart)

#
# That matters on an NFS-hosted /games, where Unix permissions are enforced and
# update_all (which runs repeatedly) strips the execute bit, while
# Install_MiSTer_Frontier.sh (which sets it) runs once. Install already uses
